# google-workspace-mcp

**One MCP server, all your Google accounts.**

A **multi-account** Google Workspace MCP server for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) — **Gmail**, **Calendar**, **Drive**, and **Tasks** across any number of Google accounts *in parallel*. Every tool takes an `account` slug, so a single Claude session can email from one account, file in another's Drive, and book an event in a third. Ships as a Claude Code **plugin** that is also its own **marketplace**.

## Why google-workspace-mcp

- **One server, every account.** Each tool call passes an `account` slug (e.g. `work`, `personal`). The server loads and refreshes that account's OAuth token transparently — no switching, no separate servers.
- **Per-project access control.** Accounts are configured at *runtime*, never baked into code. Each project's `.mcp.json` scopes it to a subset, so a personal project never even sees your work account.
- **Your own OAuth client.** You bring a (free) Google Cloud OAuth client, so you own the access and get the full tool surface — including things the default `claude.ai` connector can't do, like deleting a draft. Nothing is routed through anyone else's infrastructure.
- **Secrets stay out of the tree.** The OAuth client and per-account refresh tokens live under `~/.config/google-workspace-mcp/` (written `0600`), never next to code.
- **60 tools across six services** — see the [catalog](#tools) below.

## Install

> `/plugin` commands run **inside** Claude Code — type them at the prompt.

```text
# 1) Register the marketplace (once per machine)
/plugin marketplace add rajool/google-workspace-mcp

# 2) Install the plugin
/plugin install google-workspace-mcp@google-workspace-mcp
```

This gives you the **`/google-workspace-setup`** command, which walks you through everything in [Setup](#setup) — checking prerequisites, creating the OAuth client, defining accounts, authorizing each one in the right browser, and wiring the server into your project.

<details>
<summary><strong>No <code>/plugin</code> command?</strong> (Cowork, web, the Agent SDK) — enable it declaratively</summary>

Some environments don't expose the `/plugin` slash command. Add the block below to `.claude/settings.json` at **user level** (`~/.claude/settings.json`, applies everywhere) or **project level** (committed, so teammates get it on trust). The runtime reconciles `enabledPlugins` at startup and fetches the marketplace automatically:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "google-workspace-mcp": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "rajool/google-workspace-mcp" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "google-workspace-mcp@google-workspace-mcp": true
  }
}
```

</details>

## Setup

Requires [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) on your PATH. The `/google-workspace-setup` command automates these steps; here is the manual path.

### 1. Create your own Google Cloud OAuth client

Each user creates their own client (free):

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and create a project (or pick one).
2. **APIs & Services → Enabled APIs & services → + Enable APIs** — enable the **Gmail**, **Google Calendar**, **Google Drive**, **Google Docs**, and **Google Tasks** APIs.
3. **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen** (newer consoles: **Google Auth Platform**) — user type / audience **External**. Fill the required fields. Adding **Test users** is optional: it only matters while the app stays in *Testing*, which the next step ends.
4. **Publish the app** — **Google Auth Platform → Audience → Publish app**, moving it from *Testing* to **In production**. Don't skip this. Google issues a refresh token that **expires after 7 days** to any External app left in *Testing*, unless the app asks only for name, email address, and profile ([Refresh token expiration](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#expiration)). This server asks for full Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Tasks [scopes](#scopes), so in *Testing* every connected account dies about weekly with `invalid_grant: Bad Request` — see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).
   - **Verification is not required.** Publishing does not put you through Google's app-verification review for personal use under 100 users; verification is what lifts that 100-user cap ([Google's docs](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/13464323)).
   - **The tradeoff** is a one-time **"Google hasn't verified this app"** interstitial on first consent — click **Advanced → Go to *(your app)* (unsafe)** to continue. *Testing* shows you the same screen, so publishing costs nothing here.
5. **APIs & Services → Credentials → + Create credentials → OAuth client ID → Application type: Desktop app**. Download the JSON.
6. Save that JSON as:

   ```text
   ~/.config/google-workspace-mcp/credentials.json
   ```

### 2. Install the server binary

So a project's `.mcp.json` can launch it by name:

```bash
# from GitHub:
uv tool install git+https://github.com/rajool/google-workspace-mcp

# …or from a local clone:
uv tool install .
```

This installs two commands: `google-workspace-mcp` (the server) and `google-workspace-authorize` (the OAuth helper).

### 3. Define your accounts

Give each account a short **slug**. Two ways:

**a) A registry file** (recommended) — `~/.config/google-workspace-mcp/accounts.json` (template: [`accounts.example.json`](accounts.example.json)):

```json
{
  "accounts": {
    "work":     { "email": "you@company.com", "name": "Your Name" },
    "personal": { "email": "you@gmail.com",   "name": "Your Name" }
  }
}
```

`name` is the display name shown in the `From:` header on sent mail (set it to `""` to send with the bare address).

**b) Or inline per project** via the `GWM_ACCOUNTS` env var (see [step 5](#5-wire-it-into-a-project)) — handy if you don't want a shared registry file.

### 4. Authorize each account

This prints a Google consent URL — open it in a browser signed into *that* account and click **Allow**:

```bash
# account already in accounts.json — just the slug:
google-workspace-authorize work

# or register a brand-new account inline (adds it to accounts.json):
google-workspace-authorize personal you@gmail.com "Your Name"
```

You'll click through the "Google hasn't verified this app" warning (it's your own app) → Continue → Select all → Continue. The refresh token is written to `~/.config/google-workspace-mcp/tokens/<slug>.json`.

### 5. Wire it into a project

Add a `.mcp.json` at the project root. **`GWM_ACCOUNTS` decides which accounts this project may use:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-workspace": {
      "command": "google-workspace-mcp",
      "env": { "GWM_ACCOUNTS": "work,personal" }
    }
  }
}
```

- `GWM_ACCOUNTS` can be a **comma-list of slugs** from your registry, or an **inline JSON map** (`{"work":{"email":"…","name":"…"}}`) if you skipped the registry.
- Omit `GWM_ACCOUNTS` to expose every account in the registry.

Restart Claude Code (or reconnect MCP) to pick it up, then ask Claude to list accounts to confirm.

## Per-project access control

The point of `GWM_ACCOUNTS` is isolation: a project literally cannot act as an account that isn't in its list — the server refuses the slug. Tokens are stored centrally (authorize once), but each project's `.mcp.json` chooses its own slice:

| Project | `.mcp.json` `GWM_ACCOUNTS` | Can use |
|---|---|---|
| personal site | `personal` | personal only |
| work app | `work,support` | work + support |

## Tools

Every call requires an `account` slug. `accounts_list` shows the configured accounts and which have valid tokens.

### Gmail

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `gmail_send` | Send immediately — `to`/`cc`/`bcc`, plain or HTML, local-file `attachments`, and correct **reply threading** via `thread_id` alone. |
| `gmail_draft_create` / `gmail_draft_update` | Create a draft / overwrite its contents — `thread_id` makes it a threaded reply, quote and headers included; `attachments` ride along. |
| `gmail_draft_send` / `gmail_draft_delete` | Send a draft / permanently delete one (the thing the default connector can't do). |
| `gmail_drafts_list` | List drafts, with Gmail query syntax. |
| `gmail_search` | Search messages (`from:foo subject:bar`), returns sender/subject/date metadata in one round trip. |
| `gmail_message_get` / `gmail_thread_get` | Fetch one message (with decoded plain-text body) / a whole thread. |
| `gmail_message_modify` | Add/remove labels (e.g. mark read by removing `UNREAD`). |
| `gmail_message_trash` | Move to Trash (reversible for 30 days). |
| `gmail_labels_list` | List all labels. |
| `gmail_label_create` | Create a label (nested via `Parent/Child` names). Idempotent — an existing label is returned as-is. |
| `gmail_attachment_download` | Download one attachment to a local path (`attachment_id` from a `format=full` message). |

**Email body format.** Write `body` as plain text: blank-line paragraphs, `- ` bullets, `1.` / `1)` numbered lines (ASCII or Persian digits). The server sends it as `multipart/alternative` — the `text/plain` part byte-identical to your body, plus a generated Gmail-composer-style `text/html` part (`<div dir="auto">` per line, real `<ul>`/`<ol>` for lists). Recipients see proper paragraphs and Gmail-native bullets/numbering, RTL and LTR lines both lay out correctly, and a draft opened in the Gmail web UI can be edited and sent safely (Gmail hard-wraps plain-text-only messages at ~70 columns on Send; multipart is immune). Never hard-wrap lines yourself; pass `html=true` only when the body is already real HTML.

**Replies.** Pass `thread_id` and nothing else. The server reads the thread, appends its history below your text exactly as Gmail's web Reply does (`> `-prefixed in the plain part, a nested `<blockquote class="gmail_quote">` in the HTML part), and derives the `In-Reply-To` / `References` headers from the thread's newest message. So `body` is only ever your new message — **never paste earlier messages into it by hand**, or the recipient gets the history twice. Quoting just the newest message reproduces the full thread, because that message already carries every earlier one nested inside it. `quote_history=false` sends into the thread with no quote; `in_reply_to_message_id` overrides the derived header when you already hold the RFC822 Message-Id.

**Attachments.** Pass `attachments` as a list of paths on the machine running the server. Each file is attached under its own name with the MIME type guessed from it (`application/octet-stream` when unknown); a path that does not exist raises instead of quietly sending without the file. Attachments are added after the body, so plain-text mail keeps its `multipart/alternative` shape (inside `multipart/mixed`) and replies keep their quoted history. Attachments are capped at 25 MB per message (Gmail's own limit) and fail early with a clear error above that — upload to Drive and share a link instead. Anything inside the server's own config directory is refused, see [Trust & security](#trust--security).

### Calendar

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `calendar_list` | All calendars the account can access. |
| `calendar_events_list` | Events in a time range, with search and recurring-event expansion. |
| `calendar_event_get` | Fetch one event. |
| `calendar_event_create` | Timed or all-day events — attendees, location, timezone, invitation emails (`send_updates`), optional **Google Meet** link. |
| `calendar_event_update` | Patch only the fields you pass. |
| `calendar_event_delete` | Delete an event. |
| `calendar_create` | A new secondary calendar (a school, project, or family calendar) — returns its id for the event tools and `calendar_share`. |
| `calendar_acl_list` | Who can see a calendar — one row per sharing rule. |
| `calendar_share` | Share a calendar with one email as `freeBusyReader`, `reader`, or `writer` (`owner` is deliberately not offered); Google emails an invitation unless `send_notifications=False`. |
| `calendar_unshare` | Remove one person's access. |

### Drive

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `drive_search` | List/search with the Drive query language; shared drives included. |
| `drive_file_get` | Full metadata for one file. |
| `drive_file_download` | Download any file; **exports** Google Docs/Sheets/Slides to e.g. PDF or CSV. |
| `drive_file_upload` | Upload a local file; optionally **convert** `.docx`/`.xlsx`/`.pptx` to native Google formats. |
| `drive_file_update_content` | Replace an existing file's contents **in place** — same ID, link and sharing, previous version kept in Drive's revision history (binary files: 30 days / 100 revisions unless `keep_revision_forever`; Google Docs keep full history). Optional rename, `convert_to_google_doc` to revise a native Doc/Sheet/Slides from a local `.docx`/`.xlsx`/`.pptx`. |
| `drive_file_move` / `drive_file_rename` | Move between folders / rename. |
| `drive_file_trash` | Move to trash (reversible). |
| `drive_folder_create` | Create a folder. |
| `drive_file_share` | Share with someone by email — role from `reader` to `organizer`, optional notification message. |
| `drive_file_link_access` | Toggle "anyone with the link" access on a file the account owns, and return a direct download URL — enable, hand off, revoke. |
| `drive_comment_list` | Comments on a file with their replies and quoted text. On a Google Doc each is tagged with the **section** (heading path) it sits in; `heading=` lists just one section's. Open comments only unless `include_resolved`. |
| `drive_comment_reply` | Reply to an existing comment thread. |
| `drive_comment_resolve` | Resolve a thread (or reopen it), optionally with a closing reply. |

### Docs

Edits change the live Google Doc through the Docs API — the rest of the document, its formatting, comments and history are untouched — rather than replacing the file the way `drive_file_update_content` does.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `docs_create` | Create a Google Doc, optionally in a folder and already filled from Markdown. |
| `docs_get` | Text — or **Markdown** with its formatting, for rewrites that keep it — plus tabs, tables, `revision_id` and a heading **outline** with each section's index range: how Claude finds where to edit. |
| `docs_insert` | Insert **Markdown** (headings, bold/italic, code, links, bullets, numbered lists, checklists, **tables**, code blocks, `>` indented paragraphs) as native Docs formatting — at the start or end, after a heading's section, or at an index. |
| `docs_replace_section` | Rewrite everything under a heading with Markdown, tables included. Refuses a section holding an image, TOC or section break rather than deleting it. |
| `docs_replace_text` | Find and replace across the document or one tab; keeps the replaced text's formatting. |
| `docs_delete_range` | Delete an exact index range from `docs_get`. |
| `docs_format` | Restyle existing text — **colour**, highlight, **font**, size, bold/italic/underline — plus paragraph **alignment**, line spacing, space above/below and indent — for a heading line, a whole section, every occurrence of some text, or an index range. `background_color` is the highlight. |
| `docs_insert_image` | Insert a PNG/JPEG/GIF from a URL or a local file, placed like `docs_insert`, optionally sized. A local file is shared on Drive only while Google copies it into the Doc, then unshared and trashed. |
| `docs_table_edit` | Add or delete a table's rows and columns, or set a cell's text. |

Every write is pinned to the revision it was computed from, so an edit a person made in the meantime makes the call fail instead of landing at the wrong place. Pass `revision_id` from `docs_get` to extend that guarantee back to when Claude read the text.

> New comments aren't created yet: the Drive API can't anchor a comment to highlighted text in a Google Doc, so that is deferred until it can be done properly.

### Tasks

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `tasklist_list` / `tasklist_create` / `tasklist_delete` | Manage task lists. |
| `task_list` / `task_get` | List tasks (incl. completed/hidden) / fetch one. |
| `task_create` | New task — notes, due date, as a subtask (`parent`), ordered (`previous`). |
| `task_update` / `task_complete` | Patch fields / mark completed. |
| `task_move` | Reposition: under a parent and/or after a sibling. |
| `task_delete` | Delete a task. |

### Contacts

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `contacts_lookup` | Resolve ONE address to the name to address that person by. Tries saved contacts, then "other contacts", then the display name on real mail from that address. Returns `name: null` when nothing knows it — which is the signal that a bare address is correct. |
| `contacts_search` | Search contacts by name, address or company. Covers saved **and** "other" contacts, so someone who has only ever been emailed is still found. |

Read-only, and there for one job: Gmail shows the display name the *sender*
supplies, so a recipient written as a bare address arrives as a raw address
while everything a human sends carries a name. Look the address up, then send
to `"Firstname Lastname <addr@host>"`.

> Most names live in **other contacts** — the people Gmail recorded from
> correspondence but the user never saved — which is why both books are searched.

## Configuration & storage

Everything lives under the config home — `$GWM_HOME`, else `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/google-workspace-mcp`, else `~/.config/google-workspace-mcp/`:

| What | Path | Override |
|---|---|---|
| OAuth client secret | `<config-home>/credentials.json` | `$GWM_CREDENTIALS` |
| Account registry | `<config-home>/accounts.json` | `$GWM_ACCOUNTS_FILE` |
| Per-account tokens | `<config-home>/tokens/<slug>.json` | `$GWM_TOKENS_DIR` |
| Per-instance account scope | — | `$GWM_ACCOUNTS` |

Token files are written `0600`.

## Scopes

Broad on purpose — these are your own accounts; narrower scopes would force a re-auth every time a tool is added:

- `https://mail.google.com/`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly` *(read-only)*
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.other.readonly` *(read-only)*

> Adding a scope (as v0.3.0 did for Tasks, and v0.12.0 for Contacts) requires re-running `google-workspace-authorize <slug>` for each account. **v0.12.0 also needs the People API enabled** in the Google Cloud project behind your OAuth client — without it every contacts call returns `SERVICE_DISABLED`.

> Docs editing (v0.13.0) needs no new scope — the Docs API accepts `drive` — but the **Google Docs API must be enabled** in your Cloud project, or every `docs_*` call returns `SERVICE_DISABLED`.

> The two contact scopes are deliberately the read-only pair: this server never writes a contact.

> Being this far past Google's name/email/profile exemption is also why the OAuth app **must be published** rather than left in *Testing* — see [setup step 4](#1-create-your-own-google-cloud-oauth-client).

## Troubleshooting

### `invalid_grant: Bad Request` on every call

The account's refresh token is dead. Re-authorizing revives it:

```bash
google-workspace-authorize <slug>
```

**If it comes back roughly every week, check the OAuth app's publishing status before anything else** — Google Cloud Console → **Google Auth Platform → Audience**. If it reads *Testing*, click **Publish app** ([setup step 4](#1-create-your-own-google-cloud-oauth-client)): an External app in *Testing* is issued refresh tokens that expire after 7 days, and this server's [scopes](#scopes) are nowhere near the name/email/profile exemption. A token handed out while the app was in *Testing* keeps its 7-day clock, so re-authorize each account once after publishing.

Causes that survive **In production** — unavoidable, and each just needs one re-authorize:

- **Unused for 6 months.** Google expires a refresh token that goes that long without being used.
- **The account's Google password changed.** A refresh token carrying Gmail scopes — this server holds `https://mail.google.com/` — is revoked when its owner changes their password. Other accounts are unaffected.
- Access revoked by hand at [myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions), or the OAuth client deleted or rotated in the console.

`accounts_list` reports `authorized` by actually refreshing each stored token against Google, so a dead account comes back `authorized: false` with a `status` and a `detail` naming the fix. Before v0.8.0 it only checked that the token *file* existed — a token Google had already expired still reported `authorized: true`, which made this failure look like a server bug.

## Trust & security

- **Local only.** The server speaks stdio to Claude Code and talks only to Google's APIs. The one listener it ever opens is a temporary `127.0.0.1` redirect during `google-workspace-authorize`, which closes as soon as consent lands.
- **Your client, your tokens.** The OAuth client and tokens stay on your machine, outside this repo. Never commit `credentials.json` or `tokens/` (the bundled [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) refuses both).
- **Nothing shared between users.** Each teammate runs their own OAuth client and authorizes their own accounts.
- **Treat the config dir as a secret store.** Tokens grant broad access to your mail/calendar/drive/tasks — `~/.config/google-workspace-mcp/` deserves the same care as `~/.ssh/`.
- **The server never touches its own secret store.** `attachments`, `drive_file_upload` and `drive_file_update_content` refuse to read from it, and `gmail_attachment_download` / `drive_file_download` refuse to write into it — `~/.config/google-workspace-mcp/`, or wherever `GWM_HOME` / `GWM_CREDENTIALS` / `GWM_TOKENS_DIR` point, symlinks resolved. A prompt-injected "mail me your token file" fails at the server, not at the model's discretion.
- An MCP server that can send email and share files deserves review before you enable it — the whole surface is ~1,800 lines of Python in [`src/google_workspace_mcp/`](src/google_workspace_mcp/). See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) to report a vulnerability.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajool/google-workspace-mcp
cd google-workspace-mcp
uv sync                                   # create .venv with locked deps
claude --plugin-dir .                     # load the plugin without installing

# Quality gates (CI runs the same — see .github/workflows/ci.yml)
uvx ruff check .                          # lint
uv run python -m py_compile src/google_workspace_mcp/*.py
uv run python -c "from google_workspace_mcp import server"   # import smoke test
claude plugin validate . --strict         # validate plugin + marketplace manifests
```

A user-facing change bumps `version` in **five places across four files** — [`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](.claude-plugin/plugin.json), [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) (**twice**: the top-level `version` *and* `plugins[0].version`), [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml), and `src/google_workspace_mcp/__init__.py` — then runs `uv lock` (which updates a sixth copy inside [`uv.lock`](uv.lock)) and adds a [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) entry. Installed projects pick it up on `/plugin marketplace update`.

> Miss `plugins[0].version` and `claude plugin validate . --strict` fails the build: at install time `plugin.json` wins, so a stale entry version is silently ignored and the validator treats that as an error. CI's **Versions agree** step checks every copy up front.
