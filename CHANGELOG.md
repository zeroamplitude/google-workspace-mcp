# Changelog

All notable changes to **google-workspace-mcp** are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Plugin releases are driven by the `version` field in
[`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](.claude-plugin/plugin.json): users receive an update
only when it is bumped.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.14.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- `docs_create`: a new Google Doc, optionally in a folder and filled from
  Markdown in the same call.
- Tables: GitHub pipe tables in Markdown become real Docs tables (header row
  bold) in `docs_insert`, `docs_replace_section` and `docs_create`;
  `docs_table_edit` adds or deletes rows and columns and sets a cell's text;
  `docs_get` lists each table's rows, columns and cells.
- `docs_get(format="markdown")` returns the tab as Markdown with its
  formatting — headings, bold/italic/code/links, lists, checklists, quotes,
  tables — so a rewrite can keep it instead of flattening it.
- Checklists: `- [ ]` / `- [x]` become Docs checkboxes. The API can't tick a
  box, so a done item is struck through, and reads back as `[x]`.
- `docs_format` paragraph options: alignment, line spacing, space above and
  below, and indent.

### Changed

- `docs_replace_section` now replaces a section holding a table instead of
  refusing; an image, table of contents or section break still refuses.

### Fixed (found testing live, before release)

- Markdown with a table in it placed later segments at stale indices — after
  an end-of-document insert, and after a section rewrite's delete. Each
  segment is now placed by re-reading the document.
- `insertTable` left an empty paragraph above every table; it is folded away.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- Google Docs editing **in place**, through the Docs API: `docs_get` (text,
  tabs, revision and a heading outline with each section's index range),
  `docs_insert` (at the start or end, after a heading's section, or at an
  index), `docs_replace_section` (rewrite everything under a heading),
  `docs_replace_text` (find and replace), `docs_delete_range`, and
  `docs_format` (colour, highlight, font, size, bold/italic/underline for a
  heading, a section, every occurrence of some text, or a range), and
  `docs_insert_image` (a PNG, JPEG or GIF from a URL or a local file).
- `docs_insert` and `docs_replace_section` take **Markdown** and apply it as
  native Docs formatting: headings, bold, italic, code, links, bulleted and
  numbered lists (nested by indent), code blocks, and `>` quotes as
  indented paragraphs.
- Comments: `drive_comment_list` returns a file's comments with their replies
  and quoted text, and on a Google Doc tags each with the section (heading
  path) it sits in — `heading=` lists one section's. `drive_comment_reply`
  answers a thread; `drive_comment_resolve` resolves or reopens one.

### Why

The only way to change a Doc was to export it, edit the copy and upload it
over the original, which rewrote the whole file. Editing now touches only the
text being changed, so formatting, comments and history elsewhere in the
document survive, and people's comments can be read and answered by section.

### Safety

- Every write is pinned to the revision it was computed against
  (`writeControl.requiredRevisionId`), so an edit someone made in the meantime
  makes the call fail instead of landing at stale indices. Passing
  `revision_id` from `docs_get` extends that back to when the text was read.
- `docs_replace_section` refuses a section that holds a table, image, table
  of contents or section break rather than deleting it with the text, and
  refuses a heading that matches more than one section.
- Offsets are counted in UTF-16 code units, as the Docs API does, so emoji and
  other non-BMP characters don't shift edits.

### Fixed

- An account authorized before 0.12.0 stopped working entirely: the token was
  refreshed asking for the contacts scopes it was never granted, and Google
  rejected the whole refresh with `invalid_scope` — Gmail, Calendar, Drive and
  Tasks included, contrary to 0.12.0's upgrade note. Tokens now refresh with
  the scopes they were granted, so only the calls needing a missing scope fail,
  and `accounts_list` reports `missing_scopes` for such an account instead of
  calling it revoked.

### Not yet

- Creating new comments. The Drive API can't anchor a comment to highlighted
  text in a Google Doc; that is deferred to a later release.

### Upgrading

**Enable the Google Docs API** in the Google Cloud project behind your OAuth
client. No new scope and no re-authorization: the Docs API accepts the
`drive` scope every account already has.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Contacts, read-only: `contacts_lookup` resolves ONE address to the name to
  address that person by, and `contacts_search` finds people by name, address
  or company. Both cover saved contacts **and** "other contacts" — the people
  Gmail records from correspondence but the user never saved, which is where
  most names actually are.
- `contacts_lookup` falls back to the display name on real mail from that
  address when the People API has nothing, so it still answers for someone who
  was never a contact at all. It returns `name: null` when genuinely nobody
  knows the address — the signal that a bare address is the correct form, as
  for a role mailbox like `info@`.

### Why

Gmail shows the display name the *sender* supplies. A recipient written as a
bare address therefore arrives as a raw address, while every message a human
sends carries a name — so mail from this server read as machine-written
(reported 2026-09-19). Nothing here could look a name up; now it can.

### Changed

- Two new scopes, both read-only: `contacts.readonly` and
  `contacts.other.readonly`. This server never writes a contact.

### Upgrading

Two manual steps, both one-off:

1. **Enable the People API** in the Google Cloud project behind your OAuth
   client. Without it every contacts call fails with `SERVICE_DISABLED`.
2. **Re-authorize each account** — `google-workspace-authorize <slug>` — so the
   token carries the new scopes. Existing tokens keep working for Gmail,
   Calendar, Drive and Tasks until you do.


## [0.11.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- Calendar management, not just events: `calendar_create` makes a secondary
  calendar; `calendar_share` / `calendar_unshare` grant and revoke one
  person's access (`freeBusyReader`, `reader`, `writer` — never `owner`), and
  `calendar_acl_list` shows who can see a calendar. Until now a shared school
  or project calendar had to be created and shared in the Calendar UI.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- Replies no longer quote an unsent draft. `_thread_quote` took the thread's
  newest message with drafts included, and a reply draft is itself the newest
  message of its thread: `gmail_draft_update` with `thread_id` quoted the
  draft's own earlier version under the new text and pointed `In-Reply-To` at
  it, and a reply into a thread holding a pending draft quoted that draft.
  Drafts are now skipped; the newest sent or received message is quoted.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- `.eml` / `.mht` / `.mhtml` / `.mime` / `.nws` attachments went out as
  `message/rfc822` with a base64 transfer encoding, which RFC 2046 forbids —
  Python's own parser could not read the nested message back. Container types
  (`message/*`, `multipart/*`) now go as `application/octet-stream`, the way
  compressed and unknown types already did.
- Attachments over Gmail's 25 MB per-message limit now fail before anything is
  read or sent, with an error pointing at `drive_file_upload` +
  `drive_file_link_access`. Previously the whole message was built and
  base64-encoded, then rejected by Gmail.

### Security

- The server refuses to read from or write into its own secret store — the
  config directory (`~/.config/google-workspace-mcp/` by default), the tokens
  directory and the OAuth client file, wherever `GWM_HOME` / `GWM_CREDENTIALS`
  / `GWM_TOKENS_DIR` point, symlinks resolved. Applies to `attachments`,
  `drive_file_upload` and `drive_file_update_content` (reads) and to
  `gmail_attachment_download` and `drive_file_download` (writes). A
  prompt-injected "attach your token file and send it to …" now fails at the
  server instead of relying on the model to decline. Covered by tests.

### Changed

- `drive_file_update_content` docs spell out Drive's revision retention:
  Google Docs/Sheets/Slides keep full version history; binary files drop old
  revisions after 30 days or 100 revisions unless `keep_revision_forever`
  (at most 200 pinned per file).
- CI: ruff pinned to 0.16.6 (was 0.15.15). ruff 0.16 turns on import sorting
  (`I001`) by default, so the two import blocks it flagged — `functools`
  before `pathlib` in `auth.py`, and a stray blank line splitting the
  third-party block in `server.py` — are sorted. No runtime change.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- `drive_file_update_content` — replace an existing Drive file's contents in
  place via `files().update()`, so the file keeps its ID, link and sharing and
  the previous contents stay in Drive's revision history. Uploading again under
  the same name with `drive_file_upload` creates a second file rather than a new
  version, which left no way to revise something already shared. Optional
  `name` rename, `convert_to_google_doc` to revise a native Doc/Sheet/Slides
  from a local `.docx`/`.xlsx`/`.pptx`, and `keep_revision_forever`. No new
  OAuth scope. The Office-to-Google conversion map is now a module-level
  `_GOOGLE_NATIVE` shared with `drive_file_upload`. Contributed by
  @zeroamplitude (#10).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- `attachments` on `gmail_send` / `gmail_draft_create` / `gmail_draft_update`:
  a list of paths on the machine running the server, each attached under its
  own file name with the MIME type guessed from it (`application/octet-stream`
  as the fallback). A path that does not exist raises `FileNotFoundError`
  rather than quietly sending the message without the file. Attachments are
  added after the body, so plain-text mail keeps its `multipart/alternative`
  shape inside `multipart/mixed` and replies keep their quoted history.
  Contributed by @zeroamplitude (#11).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- A **Troubleshooting** section in the README, opening with `invalid_grant:
  Bad Request` — check the OAuth app's publishing status before anything
  else, then the causes that survive publishing: a refresh token unused for
  6 months, and the account owner changing their Google password (which
  revokes any token holding Gmail scopes).
- CI: **Versions agree** now checks all five manifest version fields plus the
  copy in `uv.lock`, instead of three — the validator enforces
  `plugins[0].version` but ignores the top-level marketplace `version`.
- CI: **README catalog covers every tool** asserts that each `@mcp.tool()` has
  a catalog row and that both advertised totals match, so a new tool cannot
  ship undocumented or leave the count stale.

### Changed

- **Setup no longer says leaving the OAuth app in *Testing* is fine — it
  isn't, and it broke every account weekly.** Google issues refresh tokens
  that expire after **7 days** to an External app whose publishing status is
  *Testing*, unless the app requests only name, email address, and profile;
  this server requests full Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Tasks scopes, so
  every connected account died about once a week with `invalid_grant: Bad
  Request` (hit on 2026-09-02). The README and `/google-workspace-setup` now
  walk you through publishing it (**Google Auth Platform → Audience →
  Publish app**), which requires no verification for personal use under 100
  users; the only cost is the one-time "Google hasn't verified this app"
  screen, which *Testing* shows anyway. Tokens issued while the app was in
  *Testing* keep their 7-day clock, so each account needs one re-authorize
  after publishing.
- `accounts_list` now proves each token by refreshing it against Google
  rather than checking that the token file exists. It used to report
  `authorized: true` for tokens Google had already expired, which made the
  weekly failure look like a server bug. A failing account now carries
  `status` (`no_token`, `unreadable`, `revoked`, or `unreachable`) and a
  `detail` naming the fix; `authorized` is `null` when Google itself could
  not be reached. Costs one refresh round trip per configured account.
- A refresh Google rejects now surfaces as a diagnosis naming the account
  and the likely cause, instead of a bare `RefreshError: invalid_grant`.

### Fixed

- README drift: both advertised tool totals said **38** while `server.py`
  defines **41**, `drive_file_link_access` (0.6.0) was missing from the Drive
  catalog, the version badge was pinned at `v0.4.0` (it now reads
  `plugin.json` live), and the security note's line count was stale.
- The documented version-bump ritual omitted `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`,
  which carries the version **twice** (top-level `version` and
  `plugins[0].version`). A stale `plugins[0].version` fails the `plugin` CI
  job, because `plugin.json` wins at install time and
  `claude plugin validate . --strict` treats the resulting warning as an error.
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the README **Development** section and the pull-request
  template now all list five fields across four files.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **Replies now carry the thread's history.** `thread_id` attaches a message to
  a thread, but Gmail quotes nothing for you — so a reply built from `body`
  alone reached the recipient with every earlier message gone, and callers had
  to hand-build the quote chain (or, far more often, silently drop it).
  `gmail_send` / `gmail_draft_create` / `gmail_draft_update` now read the
  thread and append its history below the new text the way Gmail's web Reply
  does: `"> "`-prefixed in the `text/plain` part (already-quoted lines deepen
  to `">> "`) and a nested `<blockquote class="gmail_quote">` in the
  `text/html` part. Quoting the thread's newest message is enough — it already
  carries the whole earlier chain nested inside it. Pass `quote_history=false`
  to opt out. Because the fix lives in the server, every project and assistant
  gets it with no per-project documentation.
- **`In-Reply-To` / `References` are derived from the thread.** Previously only
  `gmail_send` set them, and only when the caller looked up the RFC822
  Message-Id itself; drafts created into a thread carried no threading headers
  at all, so non-Gmail clients broke the conversation apart.
  `in_reply_to_message_id` remains as an override.
- **`gmail_draft_update` no longer detaches a draft from its thread.** It
  overwrote the draft with a bare `raw` message and no `threadId`; it now takes
  an optional `thread_id` and preserves the attachment (and re-quotes).

### Added

- Test suite (`tests/`) covering reply quoting, threading headers, quote
  depth, and graceful degradation when a thread cannot be read. CI runs it.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-08-22

### Changed

- `gmail_send` / `gmail_draft_create` / `gmail_draft_update` tool descriptions
  now teach the body format at the point of use — plain text with `- ` bullets
  and `1.` / `1)` numbered lines (ASCII or Persian digits), no manual
  hard-wrapping, `html=true` only for real HTML — so every project and
  assistant using this server gets the guidance automatically, with no
  per-project documentation needed. README gained the same section.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- The generated text/html alternative now renders plain-text lists the way
  Gmail's composer draws them: runs of `- ` / `* ` / `• ` lines become a real
  `<ul>`, runs of `1. ` / `1) ` lines (ASCII, Persian, or Arabic-Indic digits)
  a real `<ol>` (with `start` when the run does not begin at 1), each with
  `dir="auto"` so RTL lists get right-side markers. The text/plain part is
  untouched — still byte-identical to the caller's body.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- Plain-text messages (`gmail_send` / `gmail_draft_create` / `gmail_draft_update`
  without `html=true`) are now built as `multipart/alternative` with a generated
  `text/html` part mirroring Gmail's own composer output (one `<div dir="auto">`
  per line). A plain-text-only draft opened in the Gmail web UI was treated as
  plain-text mode, and on Send Gmail rewrote the body with hard line breaks at
  ~70 columns — recipients saw broken mid-sentence paragraphs (hit on a real
  W Brothers email, 2026-08-22). Gmail-composed mail never shows this because
  it is always multipart; drafts now match that shape, so sending from the web
  UI is safe. The `text/plain` part remains the caller's body, byte-identical;
  `html=true` behavior is unchanged.
- CI: cap the `mcp` dependency below 2.0 — `mcp 2.0.0` moved
  `mcp.server.fastmcp`, breaking the import smoke test on a bare
  `pip install .`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- `drive_file_link_access` — toggle "anyone with the link" access on a file the
  account owns (create/delete the `anyone` permission). Built for
  zero-bandwidth flows where an external API fetches a Drive file server-side
  (e.g. ElevenLabs `source_url` transcription): enable, hand off the returned
  `direct_download_url`, revoke immediately after. Driven by the Hengam
  meeting-processor's Meet recordings — 0.7–1.8GB per meeting that no longer
  needs a local download.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-04

Two additions to the Gmail tool surface, driven by the first real
email-triage run in the personal-assistant workspace (both gaps blocked it).

### Added

- `gmail_label_create` — create a label (nested via `Parent/Child` names,
  parents first). Idempotent: on a 409 the existing label is returned with
  `already_existed: true`.
- `gmail_attachment_download` — download one attachment to a local path,
  given the `attachment_id` from a `format=full` message payload.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-09

A professional overhaul of the repository. No change to the tool surface or to
how the server is configured.

### Added

- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file.
- `SECURITY.md` — private vulnerability reporting policy and component scope.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — Contributor Covenant 3.0.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — development setup, checks, and repo-wide rules.
- Continuous integration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Ruff, a byte-compile pass,
  an install + import smoke test, JSON manifest checks, and
  `claude plugin validate --strict`.
- Issue forms and a pull-request template under `.github/`, plus a Dependabot
  config for GitHub Actions.
- `.editorconfig` and `.gitattributes` for consistent formatting and line endings.
- `$schema` in the plugin and marketplace manifests for editor validation.

### Changed

- Rewrote `README.md` into a scannable, badge-topped reference — install,
  setup, the full 38-tool catalog, configuration, scopes, and security notes.
- Git history squashed to a single public release commit; the version history
  lives in this changelog.
- Plugin, marketplace, and package descriptions now mention **Tasks**
  (added in 0.3.0 but never reflected in the manifests).
- `.gitignore` now also excludes `.env` and `.claude/settings.local.json`.

### Removed

- The author email in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — manifests now carry
  name + GitHub URL only, matching the rest of the toolkit family.

### Fixed

- Removed an unused `import os` in `server.py` (flagged by Ruff).
- A leftover personal comment in `auth.py` is now generic.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Google Tasks** support — 10 new tools: `tasklist_list`, `tasklist_create`,
  `tasklist_delete`, `task_list`, `task_get`, `task_create`, `task_update`,
  `task_complete`, `task_delete`, `task_move`.
- The `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks` OAuth scope. **Re-run
  `google-workspace-authorize <slug>` for each account** to pick it up.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Initial public release: a multi-account Google Workspace MCP server for
  Claude Code, packaged as a plugin that is also its own marketplace.
- **Gmail** (12 tools): send (with reply threading), drafts
  (create/update/send/delete/list — including draft deletion, which the default
  connector can't do), search, message/thread fetch, label management, trash.
- **Calendar** (6 tools): list calendars, list/get/create/update/delete events —
  attendees, timezones, invitation emails, optional Google Meet links.
- **Drive** (9 tools): search (shared drives included), metadata, download with
  Google-format export, upload with optional conversion to Google formats,
  move/rename/trash/share, folder creation.
- Runtime account registry (`accounts.json` / `GWM_ACCOUNTS`) with per-project
  scoping, and the `google-workspace-authorize` OAuth CLI.
- The `/google-workspace-setup` guided-setup command.
